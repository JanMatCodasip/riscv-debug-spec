[[sec:implementations]]
== Hardware Implementations

Below are two possible implementations. A designer could choose one, mix
and match, or come up with their own design.

=== Abstract Command Based

Halting happens by stalling the hart execution pipeline.

Muxes on the register file(s) allow for accessing GPRs and CSRs using
the Access Register abstract command.

Memory is accessed using the Abstract Access Memory command or through
System Bus Access.

This implementation could allow a debugger to collect information from
the hart even when that hart is unable to execute instructions.

[[execution_based]]
=== Execution Based

This implementation only implements the Access Register abstract command
for GPRs on a halted hart, and relies on the Program Buffer for all
other operations. It uses the hart's existing pipeline and ability to
execute from arbitrary memory locations to avoid modifications to a
hart's datapath.

When the halt request bit is set, the Debug Module raises a special
interrupt to the selected harts. This interrupt causes each hart to
enter Debug Mode and jump to a defined memory region that is serviced by
the DM and is only accessible to the harts in Debug Mode. Accesses to
this memory should be uncached to avoid side effects from debugging
operations. When taking this jump, `pc` is saved to {csr-dpc} and {dcsr-cause} is updated in {csr-dcsr}. This
jump is similar to a trap but it is not architecturally considered a
trap, so for instance doesn't count as a trap for trigger behavior.

The code in the Debug Module causes the hart to execute a "park loop."
In the park loop the hart writes its `mhartid` to a memory location within the
Debug Module to indicate that it is halted. To allow the DM to
individually control one out of several halted harts, each hart polls
for flags in a DM-controlled memory location to determine whether the
debugger wants it to execute the Program Buffer or perform a resume.

To execute an abstract command, the DM first populates some internal
words of program buffer according to {dm-command}. When {accessregister-transfer} is set, the DM populates
these words with `lw <gpr>, 0x400(zero)` or `sw 0x400(zero), <gpr>`. 64-
and 128-bit accesses use `ld`/`sd` and `lq`/`sq` respectively. If {accessregister-transfer} is not
set, the DM populates these instructions as `nop's`. If {accessregister-postexec} is set, execution
continues to the debugger-controlled Program Buffer, otherwise the DM
causes an `ebreak` to execute immediately.

When `ebreak` is executed (indicating the end of the Program Buffer
code) the hart returns to its park loop. If an exception is encountered,
the hart jumps to an address within the Debug Module. The code there
causes the hart to write to the Debug Module indicating an exception.
Then the hart jumps back to the park loop. The DM infers from the write
that there was an exception, and sets {abstractcs-cmderr} appropriately. Typically the hart
will execute a `fence` instruction before entering the park loop, to
ensure that any effects from the abstract command, such as a write to {dm-data0},
take effect before the DM returns {abstractcs-busy} to 0.

To resume execution, the debug module sets a flag which causes the hart
to execute a `dret`. `dret` is an instruction that only has meaning
while in Debug Mode and not executing from the Program Buffer. Its
recommended encoding is 0x7b200073. When `dret` is executed, is restored
from {csr-dpc} and normal execution resumes at the privilege set by {dcsr-prv} and {dcsr-v}.

{dm-data0} etc. are mapped into regular memory at an address relative to with only
a 12-bit `imm`. The exact address is an implementation detail that a
debugger must not rely on. For example, the `data` registers might be
mapped to `0x400`.

For additional flexibility, {dm-progbuf0}, etc. are mapped into regular memory
immediately preceding {dm-data0}, in order to form a contiguous region of memory
which can be used for either program execution or data transfer.

The PMP must not disallow fetches, loads, or stores in the address range
associated with the Debug Module when the hart is in Debug Mode,
regardless of how the PMP is configured. The same is true of PMA.
Without this guarantee, the park loop would enter an infinite loop of
traps and debug would not be possible.

[[dmi_signals]]
=== Debug Module Interface Signals

As stated in section <<dmi>> the details of the DMI are left to
the system designer. It is quite often the case that only one DTM and
one DM is implemented. In this case it might be useful to comply with
the signals suggested in <<tab:dmi_signals>>, which is the
implementation used in the open-source
https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip/blob/375045a7db1bdc7b4f7851f1a59b3f10a2b922ff/src/main/scala/devices/debug/Debug.scala#L170[rocket-chip]
RISC-V core.

The DTM can start a request when the DM sets REQ_READY to 1. When this
is the case REQ_OP can be set to 1 for a read or 2 for a write request.
The desired address is driven with the REQ_ADDRESS signal. Finally
REQ_VALID is set high, indicating to the DM that a valid request is
pending.

The DM must respond to a request from the DTM when RSP_READY is high.
The status of the response is indicated by the RSP_OP signal (see {dmi-op}). The
data of the response is driven to RSP_DATA. A pending response is
signalled by setting RSP_VALID.
